I am using one of my "late's" on this assignment

Window idle times are no longer counted once the queue is empty, as these
employees could then leave.

Added Features:
Metrics output includes that which was specified in the Assignment Description,
but also includes:
-Total Time of Simulation
-Number of Students
-Number of Windows
-Median of Window Idle Times

Medians are calculated by finding middle value.  If there are two middle
values (even data set), the smaller value is taken, as directed to in class
on 11/17/2020.  Wait time and idle times of 0 are included when finding the
median.
Means are computed only with values larger than 0.
Only times that are more than 10 and 5 respectively counted, does not include
times of 10 not 5
